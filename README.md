# Fuzzing Example

# Getting Started

## Requirements

Please install the following:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)  
    -   You'll know you've done it right if you can run `git --version`
-   [Foundry / Foundryup](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry)
    -   This will install `forge`, `cast`, and `anvil`
    -   You can test you've installed them right by running `forge --version` and get an output like: `forge 0.2.0 (f016135 2022-07-04T00:15:02.930499Z)`
    -   To get the latest of each, just run `foundryup`

And you probably already have `make` installed... but if not [try looking here.](https://askubuntu.com/questions/161104/how-do-i-install-make)

## Quickstart

```sh
git clone https://github.com/patrickalphac/fuzzing-example
cd fuzzing-example
forge install
```

## Testing

```
forge test
```

You'll see it currently fails!
